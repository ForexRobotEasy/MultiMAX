This ReadMe file provides an overview of the code for managing Forex trades using the Forex Robot Easy Team's trading system. This code is a sample implementation and is not the official product developed by Forex Robot Easy.

## Code Overview

The code is written in MQL4 language and consists of several functions and global variables to manage Forex trades. Here is a brief overview of the code:

### Libraries

The code imports the necessary library, `Trade.mqh`, to interact with the trading platform and perform trade-related operations.

### Constants

The code defines two constants:
- `MAX_TRADES`: Maximum number of trades that can be opened simultaneously.
- `MAX_EXPOSURE`: Maximum exposure limit for all trades combined.

### Trade Structure

The code defines a structure, `TradeInfo`, to store information about each trade. The structure has three properties:
- `entryPrice`: Entry price of the trade.
- `stopLoss`: Stop loss level for the trade.
- `takeProfit`: Take profit level for the trade.

### Global Variables

The code declares two global variables:
- `trades`: An array of `TradeInfo` structures to store information about multiple trades.
- `tradeCount`: The current number of open trades.

### Functions

1. `OpenTrade`: This function opens a new trade. It takes parameters such as symbol, lot size, entry price, stop loss, and take profit. It checks if the maximum number of trades has been reached or if the exposure limit will be exceeded before opening the trade.

2. `CloseTrade`: This function closes a trade based on the provided symbol. It searches for the trade in the `trades` array, closes the trade, and removes it from the array.

3. `AdjustTradeSettings`: This function adjusts the stop loss and take profit levels for a trade based on the provided symbol. It searches for the trade in the `trades` array, updates the trade information, and modifies the trade order.

4. `OnStart`: This is the entry point of the program. It demonstrates the usage of the above functions by opening trades, closing trades, adjusting trade settings, and closing all remaining trades. It also prints the status of each operation.
